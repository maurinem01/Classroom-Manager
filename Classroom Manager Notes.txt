1. RE-AUTHENTICATION ON STARTUP
The program MUST be authenticated upon startup.  Do not close the Google Login window!  Failure to authenticate 
will stop the program to ensure emails are sent during class sessions.  If this happens, restart the computer.

Open Classroom Manager and a browser window will open.  Use the following login information:
	Email: 
	Password: 

"You’ve been given access to an app that’s currently being tested. 
You should only continue if you know the developer that invited you."
	Click Continue

"Classroom Manager wants access to your Google Account"
	Click Continue

Once the preceding steps are followed, the browser can be closed.

2. EDIT STUDENTS > COLOURED DOT INDICATOR
Students can now be tagged with Centre Graded, Home Graded, Kumon Connect, or None (default).
The colours for each tag will be customizable later in the week.

3. ALERTS WHEN STUDENTS COME OUTSIDE THEIR ALLOTTED TIME
If a student signs in outside of +/- 15 minutes of their scheduled time on Acuity, an exclamation icon will
appear beside their name.  It may take a few seconds after sign-in for the icon to appear.
